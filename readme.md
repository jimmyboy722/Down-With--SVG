# <ins>SVG Generator</ins>
------------------------------------------
## <ins>What is an SVG file?</ins>
- SVG is an acronym that stands for <ins>Scalable Vector Graphics</ins>
- SVG's are made up of <ins>vector graphics</ins>, as opposed to pixels, meaning they can be scaled to any
  size without compromising the quality of the image.
- They are XML file to be precise, which means they're comprised of markup tags that alow them to
  be easily edited and customized.
- Most commonly used for logos or icons, SVG images are also generally smaller in file size than
  pixel-based images.
